Input data for the independent Gaussian code. Each VTK file comprises two fields, namely, mean and variance. Mean and variance fields store the average and variance at each point. 

The "prepare-tangle-data" Jupyter notebook is provided as a sample script to generate the uncertain tangle data for various noise models.
